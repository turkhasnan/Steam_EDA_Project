# STEAM EDA PROJECT
### Got the project from one of my favorite data YouTubers Shashank Kalanithi

To see my DeepNote (has the datasets, which were too large to upload on GitHub), [click here](https://deepnote.com/workspace/turkhasnan-7862-7a4fd62c-5f66-41c8-9f6f-997a38501d25/project/A-Day-in-the-Life-of-a-Data-Analyst-Shared-Duplicate-4ba52e88-1a23-43d5-ad16-a0cce9d630e5/%2FSteam_EDA_Project%2Fsteam_eda_project.ipynb)

The video is called "Day in the Life of a Data Analyst: Stakeholder ➡️ Co-Worker ➡️ SQL ➡️ Python ➡️ Visualizations"

The project consists of a fraction of Steam data (about 1 million records). The goal of the project is to fulfill a stakeholder's request.
The goal is to define what a "top reviewer" is and to find the top 1000 reviewers based on definition of a "top reviewer" to create an incentive and rewarding these users for creating reviews for games.

Utilized Pandas, Plotly, Matplotib, and SQL
