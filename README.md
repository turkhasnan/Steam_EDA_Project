# STEAM EDA PROJECT
### Got the project from one of my favorite data YouTubers Shashank Kalanithi

The video is called "Day in the Life of a Data Analyst: Stakeholder ➡️ Co-Worker ➡️ SQL ➡️ Python ➡️ Visualizations"

The project consists of a fraction of Steam data (about 1 million records). The goal of the project is to fulfill a stakeholder's request.
The goal is to define what a "top reviewer" is and to find the top 1000 reviewers based on definition of a "top reviewer" to create an incentive and rewarding these users for creating reviews for games.

Utilized Pandas, Plotly, Matplotib, and SQL
